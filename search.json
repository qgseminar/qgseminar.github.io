    "text": "Session 2023–2024\n\n\nAutumn Session\n\n\nMateusz Wasilewki (IMPAN) - October 16, 2023\n\n\nTitle: Quantum Cayley graphs.\nAbstract: I will talk about a method of associating a quantum graph to a discrete quantum group together with a projection in its function algebra. These quantum graphs are analogues of Cayley graphs and they do not depend on the choice of a generating projection in the sense of metric geometry. Later I will show how they can help in finding examples of finite quantum groups having Frucht property, i.e. arising as quantum automorphism groups of quantum graphs.\nPart of the talk will be based on an on-going joint work with Michael Brannan and Adam Skalski.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nAmaury Freslon (Université Paris-Saclay) - October 23, 2023\n\n\nTitle: Classical actions of quantum permutations.\nAbstract: Quantum permutation groups can act non-trivially, and even ergodically, on finite spaces. This is, in view of many quantum rigidity results, an exception and it is natural to wonder whether there are other classical spaces on which quantum permutations can act. H. Huang constructed a family of such spaces, and we will show that these are the only possibilities. This is a joint work with F. Taipe and S. Wang.\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Anderson-Sackaney (Université de Caen) - November 13, 2023\n\n\nTitle: Topological Boundaries of Representations and Coideals.\nAbstract: We will introduce and study quantum analogues of Furstenberg-Hamana boundaries of representations of discrete quantum groups, where the Furstenberg boundary is the Furstenberg-Hamana boundary of the left regular representation. Our focus is on the GNS representations of idempotent states, or to put it differently, the quasi-regular representations coming from coideals associated to compact quasi-subgroups. We use their Furstenberg-Hamana boundaries to study (co)amenability properties of such coideals. Then, we combine our work with recent work of Hataishi and De Ro to settle open problems of Kalantar, Kasprzak, Skalski, and Vergnioux for wide classes of quantum groups, including unimodular discrete quantum groups and C*-exact discrete quantum groups. For example, we prove that a unimodular discrete quantum group has the unique trace property iff it acts faithfully on its Furstenberg boundary.\nThis is joint work with Fatemeh Khosravi.\n\n\n\n\nRobert Yuncken (Université de Lorraine) - November 20, 2023\n\n\nTitle: Crystallizing compact semisimple Lie groups.\nAbstract: The theory of crystal bases is a means of simplifying the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras by passing through quantum groups. Varying the parameter q of the quantized enveloping algebras, we pass from the classical theory at \\(​q=1\\) through the Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras at \\(0&lt;q&lt;1\\) to the crystal limit at \\(q=0\\). At this point, the main features of the representation theory crystallize into purely combinatorial data described by crystal graphs. In this talk, we will describe what happens to the \\(C^*\\)-algebra of functions on a compact semisimple Lie group under the crystallization process, yielding higher-rank graph algebras. This is joint work with Marco Matassa.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nMalte Gerhold (Saarland University) - November 27, 2023\n\n\nTitle: Cohomology of free unitary quantum groups.\nAbstract: In the talk, we will discuss the free unitary quantum groups (or “universal quantum groups”) of Wang and van Daele from a (co)homological perspective. We find a /free resolution of the counit/, a versatile tool which helps to compute cohomological data such as Hochschild cohomology or bialgebra cohomology of the associated Hopf algebras. For free orthogonal quantum groups, such resolutions have been found by Collins, Härtel, and Thom (in the Kac-case) and Bichon (in the general case), and they will serve as our starting point for finding resolutions for free unitary quantum groups.\nBased on joint work with I. Baraquin, U. Franz, A. Kula and M. Tobolski [arXiv:2309.07767]\n\n\n\n\nSiegfried Echterhoff (WWU Münster) - December 4, 2023\n\n\nTitle: Proper actions, fixed-point algebras, and deformation via coactions.\nAbstract: The notion of proper actions of groups on spaces has various generalizations for group actions of noncommutative \\(C^*\\)-algebras \\(A\\), which all allow the construction of generalized fixed-point algebras \\(A^G\\) which are Morita equivalent to ideals in the reduced crossed products \\(A\\ltimes G\\). The weakest version was introduced by Rieffel in 1990 and it played an important role in his theory of deformations via actions of \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\).\nIn this talk we want to report on some joint work with Alcides Buss on a version of proper actions which allows the construction of maximal (or exotic) generalized fixed-point algebras which are Morita equivalent to ideals in the maximal (resp. exotic) crossed products. We will report on several applications including Landstad duality for coactions and deformation of \\(C^*\\)-algebras via coactions in the sense of Kasprzak and Bowmick, Neshveyev, and Sangha.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nWinter Session\n\n\nUwe Franz (Laboratoire de mathématiques de Besançon) - January 22, 2024\n\n\nTitle: Gaussian Parts of Compact Quantum Groups.\nAbstract: We introduce the Gaussian part of a compact quantum group \\(G\\), namely the largest quantum subgroup of \\(G\\) supporting all the Gaussian functionals of \\(G\\). We prove that the Gaussian part is always contained in the Kac part, and characterise Gaussian parts of classical compact groups, duals of classical discrete groups and q-deformations of compact Lie groups. The notion turns out to be related to a new concept of “strong connectedness” and we exhibit several examples of both strongly connected and totally strongly disconnected compact quantum groups. Joint work with Amaury Freslon and Adam Skalski.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nJoeri De Ro (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) - January 29, 2024\n\n\nTitle: Equivariant injectivity of crossed products.\nAbstract: We introduce the notion of a \\(G\\)-operator space, which consists of an action of a locally compact quantum group \\(G\\) on an operator space \\(X\\), and we study the notion of \\(G\\)-equivariant injectivity for such an operator space. We define a natural associated crossed product operator space \\(X \\rtimes G\\), on which both the locally compact quantum group \\(G\\) and its dual act. We completely characterise when these crossed products are equivariantly injective with respect to these actions. We discuss how these results generalise and unify several recent results from the literature and we give some new applications.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nSergio Girón Pacheco (KU Leuven) - February 5, 2024\n\n\nTitle: Intertwining techniques for actions of \\(C^*\\)-tensor categories.\nAbstract: Intertwining techniques, first used in the realm of \\(C^*\\)-algebras in Elliott’s classification of AF-algebras, have been essential in the classification theory of \\(C^*\\)-algebras and their group actions. In this talk I will discuss intertwining and how it appears in \\(C^*\\)-classification, I will then outline an adaptation of these techniques to the tensor category equivariant setting. Time permitting I will discuss an application of these techniques to the study of tensor category equivariant Jiang-Su stability.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nKent Vashaw (MIT) - February 12, 2024\n\n\nTitle: Quantum-symmetric equivalence via Manin’s universal quantum groups.\nAbstract: We study \\(2\\)-cocycle (and more generally quantum-symmetric equivalences between) twists of graded algebras via their associated universal quantum groups, in the sense of Manin. We prove that Zhang twists arise as a special case of \\(2\\)-cocycle twist, and that \\(2\\)-cocyle twisting preserves many fundamental homological invariants of graded algebras. As a consequence, we give a characterization of Artin–Schelter regular algebras using the language of \\(2\\)-cocycle twists.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nRobert Laugwitz (University of Nottingham) - February 19, 2024\n\n\nTitle: Induced functors on Drinfeld centers.\nAbstract: I will explain how the right/left adjoint of a monoidal functor induced a braided lax/oplax monoidal functors between the corresponding Drinfeld centers. This requires some mild technical assumptions, namely that the projection formulas hold for the adjoint functor. This holds, for example, when the monoidal categories are rigid. As the induced functors on the Drinfeld centers are (op)lax and compatible with braiding, they preserve commutative (co)algebra objects. As classes of examples, we consider monoidal restriction functors along extensions of Hopf algebras leading to (co)induction functors on Yetter-Drinfeld module categories. This is joint work in progress with Johannes Flake (Bonn) and Sebastian Posur (Münster).\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nLyudmila Turowska (Chalmers University of Technology/University of Gothenburg) - March 4, 2024\n\n\nTitle: No-signalling values of cooperative quantum games.\nAbstract: Finding values, the optimal winning probability, of various non-local games over different strategies has been an important task in Quantum Information Theory and also for resolving the Connes Embedding Problem. In this talk I will discuss values of quantum games (games with quantum inputs and outputs), arising from the type hierarchy of quantum no-signalling correlations, establishing operator space tensor norm expressions for each of the correlation types. This is a joint work with Jason Crann, Rupert Levene and Ivan Todorov.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nVictor Ostrik (University of Oregon) - March 11, 2024\n\n\nTitle: Growth in tensor powers.\nAbstract: This talk is based on joint work with K.Coulembier, P.Etingof, D.Tubbenhauer. Let \\(G\\) be any group and let \\(V\\) be a finite dimensional representation of \\(G\\) over some field. We consider tensor powers of \\(V\\) and their decompositions into indecomposable summands. The main question which will be addressed in this talk: what can we say about count (e.g. total number) of these indecomposable summands? It turns out that there are reasonable partial answers to this question asymptotically, i.e. when the tensor power is large.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nSpring Session\n\n\nChiara Esposito (University of Salerno) - May 13, 2024\n\n\nTitle: Equivariant formality and reduction.\nAbstract: In this talk, we discuss the reduction-quantization diagram in terms of formality. First, we propose a reduction scheme for multivector fields and multidifferential operators, phrased in terms of L-infinity morphisms. This requires the introduction of equivariant multivector fields and equivariant multidifferential operator complexes, which encode the information of the Hamiltonian action, i.e., a \\(G\\)-invariant Poisson structure allowing for a momentum map. As a second step, we discuss an equivariant version of the formality theorem, conjectured by Tsygan and recently solved in a joint work with Nest, Schnitzer, and Tsygan. This result has immediate consequences in deformation quantization, since it allows for obtaining a quantum moment map from a classical momentum map with respect to a G-invariant Poisson structure.\n\n\n\n\nEdward Pearce-Crump (Imperial College London) - May 20, 2024\n\n\nTitle: Compact Matrix Quantum Group Equivariant Neural Networks.\nAbstract: In deep learning, we would like to develop principled approaches for constructing neural networks. One important approach involves identifying symmetries that are inherent in data and then encoding them into neural network architectures using representations of groups. However, there exist so-called “quantum symmetries” that cannot be understood formally by groups. In this talk, we show how to construct neural networks that are equivariant to compact matrix quantum groups using Woronowicz’s version of Tannaka-Krein duality. We go on to characterise the linear weight matrices that appear in these neural networks for a class of compact matrix quantum groups known as “easy”. In particular, we show that every compact matrix group equivariant neural network is a compact matrix quantum group equivariant neural network.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nJacek Krajczok (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) - May 27, 2024\n\n\nTitle: Modular invariants of quantum groups.\nAbstract: A very interesting feature of compact quantum groups is that their Haar integral, which is a normal state on \\(L^\\infty(G)\\), can be non-tracial. Via Tomita-Takesaki theory, this gives rise to two groups of automorphisms: modular automorphisms and scaling automorphisms. One can use them to define a number of invariants, related to whether these automorphisms are trivial, inner or approximately inner. During the talk I’ll introduce such invariants (also in the general locally compact case), discuss a conjecture related to one of them, and present their calculation in the case of q-deformed compact, simply connected, semisimple Lie group \\(G_q\\). The talk is based on a joint work with Piotr Sołtan.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nRolan Vergnioux (Université de Caen) - June 3, 2024\n\n\nTitle: Maximal amenability of the radial subalgebra in free quantum groups factors.\nAbstract: The free orthogonal quantum groups \\(O^+(N)\\), introduced by Shuzhou Wang, are monoidally equivalent to the \\(SU_q(2)\\) compact quantum groups, but on an analytical level they behave much like the quantum duals of the classical free groups, when \\(N &gt; 2\\). I will review their definition and main properties, and present a new result about the maximal amenability of the associated radial MASA, obtained in recent joint work with Xumin Wang.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nLukas Rollier (KU Leuven) - June 10, 2024\n\n\nTitle: Quantum automorphism groups of discrete structures.\nAbstract: Given any mathematical structure, it is a natural question to ask which quantum symmetries it admits. One can in general not hope to find a quantum automorphism group for any structure in the framework of Kustermans-Vaes, as a necessary condition for its existence is local compactness of the classical automorphism group. In recent work, a wide range of discrete structures, those which are connected and locally finite in a suitable sense, were shown to admit an algebraic quantum automorphism group. The main tool for their construction is a generalization of the Tannaka-Krein-Woronowicz reconstruction theorem. In particular, this allows to construct quantum automorphism groups of connected locally finite quantum graphs, such as Wasilewski’s quantum Cayley graphs, generalizing joint results with Stefaan Vaes.\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Gromada (Czech Technical University in Prague) - June 17, 2024\n\n\nTitle: Cayley graphs: Symmetries, quantizations, duality.\nAbstract:\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nKen Goodearl (University of California, Santa Barbara) - June 24, 2024 at 9:00 am (CEST)\n\n\nTitle: Spectra of quantum algebras.\nAbstract: The talk will survey what is known and/or conjectured about the prime and primitive spectra of quantum algebras, particularly quantized coordinate rings and related algebras such as quantized Weyl algebras. The topological structure of these spectra, their relations with classical algebraic varieties, and their relations with each other will be discussed.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nMarco Matassa (Oslo Metropolitan University) - July 1st, 2024\n\n\nTitle: Equivariant quantizations of the positive nilradical and covariant differential calculi.\nAbstract: We consider the problem of quantizing the positive nilradical of a complex semisimple Lie algebra of finite rank, together with a certain fixed direct sum decomposition. The decompositions we consider are in one-to-one correspondence with total orders on the simple roots, and exhibit the nilradical as a direct sum of graded modules for appropriate Levi factors. We show that this situation can be quantized equivariantly as a finite-dimensional subspace within the positive part of the corresponding quantized enveloping algebra. Furthermore, we show that such subspaces give rise to left coideals, with the possible exception of components corresponding to some exceptional Lie algebras, and this property singles them out uniquely. Finally, we discuss how to use these quantizations to construct covariant first-order differential calculi on quantum flag manifolds, which coincide with those introduced by Heckenberger-Kolb in the irreducible case."

We will discuss the construction of this Brownian motion, computing its cutoff, where convergence to equilibrium undergoes a sharp transition. We will also examine the cutoff profile, analyzing the fine-scale behavior of the total variation distance around the cutoff. Unlike classical or orthogonal quantum groups, the study of \\(UN+\\)​ has additional challenges, such as non-absolute continuity, distinct properties of its central algebra and inabilities to clearly identify a Brownian motion.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nMalte Leimbach (Radboud University) - December 16, 2024\n\n\nTitle: Convergence of Peter–Weyl Truncations of Compact Quantum Groups.\nAbstract: A fundamental principle of noncommutative geometry is to encode geometric information by spectral data, formalised in the notion of spectral triples. In physical practice there are, however, always obstructions on the availability of such data, and one might be led to considering truncated versions of spectral triples instead. In this talk we will take a closer look at this formalism and explore it within the framework of compact quantum metric spaces. In particular we will consider compact quantum groups as compact quantum metric spaces when equipped with an invariant lip-norm. We will discuss complete Gromov–Hausdorff convergence of truncations arising from the Peter–Weyl decomposition of a compact quantum group.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nWinter Session\n\n\nJulio Cáceres (Vanderbilt University) - February 3, 2025\n\n\nTitle: New hyperfinite subfactors with infinite depth.\nAbstract: We will present new examples of irreducible, hyperfinite subfactors with trivial standard invariant and interesting Jones indices. These are obtained by constructing new finite dimensional commuting squares. We will use two graph planar algebra embedding theorems and the classification of small index subfactors to show that our commuting square subfactors cannot have finite depth. We also present one-parameter families of commuting squares that, by a classification result of Kawahigashi, will also yield irreducible infinite depth subfactors. This is joint work with Dietmar Bisch.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nRoberto Hernández Palomares (University of Waterloo) - March 17, 2025\n\n\nTitle: Quantum graphs, subfactors and tensor categories.\nAbstract: We will introduce equivariant graphs with respect to a quantum symmetry along with examples such as classical graphs, Cayley graphs of finite groupoids, and their quantum analogues. These graphs can be presented concretely by modeling a quantum vertex set by an inclusion of operator algebras and the quantum edge set by an equivariant endomorphism, idempotent with respect to convolution/Schur product. Equipped with this viewpoint and tools from subfactor theory, we will see how to obtain all these idempotents using higher relative commutants and the quantum Fourier transform. Finally, we will state a quantum version of Frucht’s Theorem, showing that every quasitriangular finite quantum groupoid arises as certain automorphisms of some categorified graph.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nSpring Session\n\n\nSang-Gyun Youn (Seoul National University) - March 31, 2025 at 10:00 am (CEST)\n\n\nTitle: A Khintchine inequality for central Fourier series on non-Kac compact quantum groups.\nAbstract: The study of Khintchine inequalities has a long history in abstract harmonic analysis. While there is almost no possibility of non-trivial Khintchine inequality for central Fourier series on compact connected semisimple Lie groups, it has turned out that a strong contrast holds within the framework of compact quantum groups. Specifically, a Khintchine inequality with operator coefficients is proved for arbitrary central Fourier series in a large class of non-Kac compact quantum groups. The main examples include the Drinfeld-Jimbo \\(q\\)-deformations, the free orthogonal quantum groups, and the quantum automorphism groups.\n\n\n\n\nHeon Lee (Harbin Institute of Technology) - April 7, 2025\n\n\nTitle: First-order differential calculi and Laplacians on \\(q\\)-deformations of compact semisimple Lie groups.\nAbstract: In this talk, we suggest a simple definition of Laplacian on a compact quantum group (CQG) associated with a first-order differential calculus (FODC) on it. Applied to the classical differential calculus on a compact Lie group, this definition yields classical Laplacians, as it should. Moreover, on the CQG \\(K_q\\) arising from the \\(q\\)-deformation of a compact semisimple Lie group \\(K\\), we can find many interesting linear operators that satisfy this definition, which converge to a classical Laplacian on \\(K\\) as \\(q\\) tends to \\(1\\). In the light of this, we call them \\(q\\)-Laplacians on \\(K_q\\) and investigate some of their operator theoretic properties. In particlar, we show that the heat semigroups generated by these are not completely positive, suggesting that perhaps on the CQG \\(K_q\\), stochastic processes that are most relevant to the geometry of it are not quantum Markov processes. This work is based on the preprint arXiv:2410.00720.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nHua Wang (Harbin Institute of Technology) - April 14, 2025\n\n\nTitle: A Theory of Locally Convex Hopf Algebras – I. Basic Theory and Examples.\nAbstract: This is the first of two talks on a recent theory of locally convex Hopf algebras. After a brief introduction to some relevant facts on locally convex spaces as well as their topological tensor products, we will describe the main theory with an emphasis on duality. We will see that besides the usual strong dual, the theory encompasses naturally a new type of dual called the polar dual. After presenting the main theoretical results, we will illustrate the theory with various examples. In particular, we will see how to resolve the duality problem for classical Hopf algebras, how to describe a Lie group as well as its dual using smooth functions, and how to incorporate compact and discrete quantum groups into this framework.\n\n\n\n\nHua Wang (Harbin Institute of Technology) - April 21, 2025\n\n\nTitle: A Theory of Locally Convex Hopf Algbebras – II. More Duality Results and Examples.\nAbstract: This is the second of two talks on a recent theory of locally convex Hopf algebras. We will start by presenting a generalized version of the Gelfand duality, and later apply it in various situations to obtain the underlying topological group from the corresponding locally convex Hopf algebras. Surprisingly, we can go much beyond the locally compact case in this classical situation, and make the theory work for all topological groups with compactly generated topology. Then we shift to some categorical considerations, allowing us to obtain new topological quantum groups as well as their dualities that seem not in the locally compact framework of Kustermans-Vaes. If time permits, we will conclude by mentionning how some deep structural results related to Hilbert’s fifth problem can be applied in this theory.\n\n\n\n\nFarrokh Razavinia (Non Resident Researcher at IPM) - May 19, 2025\n\n\nTitle: \\(C^*\\)-graph algebras and beyond.\nAbstract: Graph \\(C^*\\)-algebras have shown their importance in mathematics and other disciplines. For instance, recall the theory of quantum groups and quantum graphs, they can provide us with required structures in proving or disproving some interrelated problems. For example, in our recent papers, we showed their importance in looking at some very well-known wonder questions in mathematics from a different direction. In this talk, we will present some elementary definitions and results concerning graph \\(C^*\\)-algebras, and then we will try to study some constructive examples, and after that we will take a look at the concept of \\(C^*\\)-colored graph algebras, and finally we will see how these structures will help us to move into some very abstract mathematical objects!\nSlides"

The representable localization algebra for \\(X\\) was introduced and studied by Willett and Yu. The K-theory of the algebra serves as the representable K-homology of the space \\(X\\).\nNow let \\(G\\) be a second countable, locally compact group and suppose that \\(X\\) is a proper \\(G\\)-space. It turns out that the K-theory of the crossed product by \\(G\\) of the representable localization algebra for \\(X\\) serves as the representable \\(G\\)-equivariant K-homology of the proper \\(G\\)-space \\(X\\).\nThe goal of this talk is to describe these facts and roles of the representable localization algebras in the study of the Baum—Connes conjecture.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nDominic Verdon (University of Bristol) - September 27, 2021\n\n\nTitle: A covariant Stinespring theorem.\nAbstract: We will introduce a finite-dimensional covariant Stinespring theorem for compact quantum groups. Let \\(G\\) be a compact quantum group, and let \\(T:= \\text{Rep}(G)\\) be the rigid \\(C^*\\)-tensor category of finite-dimensional continuous unitary representations of \\(G\\). Let \\(\\text{Mod}(T)\\) be the rigid \\(C^*\\)-\\(2\\)-category of cofinite semisimple finitely decomposable \\(T\\)-module categories. We show that finite-dimensional \\(G\\)-\\(C^*\\)-algebras (a.k.a \\(C^*\\)-dynamical systems) can be identified with equivalence classes of \\(1\\)-morphisms out of the object \\(T\\) in \\(\\text{Mod}(T)\\). For \\(1\\)-morphisms \\(X: T -&gt; M1\\), \\(Y: T -&gt; M2\\), we show that covariant channels between the corresponding \\(G\\)-\\(C^*\\)-algebras can be ‘dilated’ to isometries \\(t: X -&gt; Y \\otimes E\\), where \\(E: M2 -&gt; M1\\) is some ‘environment’ \\(1\\)-morphism. Dilations are unique up to partial isometry on the environment; in particular, the dilation minimising the quantum dimension of the environment is unique up to a unitary. When \\(G\\) is a compact group this implies and generalises previous covariant Stinespring-type theorems.\nWe will also discuss some results relating to rigid \\(C^*\\)-\\(2\\)-categories, including that any connected semisimple rigid \\(C^*\\)-\\(2\\)-category is equivalent to \\(\\text{Mod}(T)\\) for some rigid \\(C^*\\)-tensor category \\(T\\). (Here semisimple means not just semisimplicity of \\(\\text{Hom}\\)-categories but also idempotent splitting for \\(1\\)-morphisms, direct sums for objects, etc.)\nThis talk is based on the paper arXiv:2108.09872.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nAdam Skalski (IMPAN) - October 4, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Gaussian states and Gaussian parts of compact quantum groups.\nAbstract: I will motivate and explain the notion of a Gaussian state on a compact quantum group \\(G\\), as introduced by Michael Schürmann. This concept leads to the idea of the Gaussian part of \\(G\\), understood as the smallest quantum subgroup of \\(G\\) which supports all the Gaussian states of \\(G\\). I will discuss properties of Gaussian states and compute Gaussian parts for several examples. This turns out to be related to quantum connectedness and certain topological generation questions for quantum subgroups. The talk will be based on joint work with Uwe Franz and Amaury Freslon.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nJulian Kranz (University of Münster) - October 11, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Amenability and weak containment for étale groupoids.\nAbstract: A famous theorem of Hulanicki says that a locally compact group is amenable if and only if its full and reduced \\(C^*\\)-algebras coincide. For groupoids, the situation is more delicate: While amenabiltiy implies equatility of the full and reduced \\(C^*\\)-algebra, the converse fails according to examples by Willett. The behavior of Willett’s groupoids can be explained by their non-exactness. We show that if an étale groupoid satisfies a certain exactness condition, then equality of its full and reduced \\(C^*\\)-algebra is equivalent to amenability of the groupoid.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nJonas Wahl (University of Bonn) - October 25, 2021\n\n\nTitle: An introduction to diagram algebras.\nAbstract: In this talk, I will introduce the notion of a diagram algebra and explain their connection to the representation theory of compact quantum groups. I will also describe the role that they play for loop models in statistical physics as well as the correspondence between their traces and random walks on graphs.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nDavid Jordan (University of Edinburgh) - November 1st, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Cluster quantization from factorization homology.\nAbstract: The character variety of a manifold is its moduli space of flat \\(G\\)-bundles. These moduli spaces and their quantizations appear in a number of places in mathematics, representation theory, and quantum field theory. Famously, Fock and Goncharov showed that a certain “decorated” variant of character varieties carries the structure of a cluster variety – that is, the moduli space contains a distinguished set of toric charts, with combinatorially defined transitions functions (called mutations). This led them to a now-famous quantization of their decorated character varieties.\nIn this talk I’ll explain that the by-hands construction of these charts by Fock and Goncharov can in fact be extracted from a more general framework called stratified factorization homology, and I’ll outline how this allows us to extend the Fock-Goncharov story from surfaces to 3-manifolds.\n\n\n\n\nApurva Seth (Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal) - November 8, 2021\n\n\nTitle: \\(C(X)\\)-Algebras and their K-Stability.\nAbstract: Non-stable K-theory is the study of the homotopy groups of the group of (quasi-) unitaries of a \\(C^*\\)-algebra. We will give an overview of the theory, and discuss a special class of \\(C^*\\)-algebras, termed as K-stable \\(C^*\\)-algebras along with its rational analogue. We shall give a permanence property related to K-stability (rational Kstability) concerning continuous \\(C(X)\\)-algebras. We will end with an application of the aforementioned result to crossed product \\(C^*\\)-algebras.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nFloris Elzinga (University of Oslo) - November 23, 2021 at 11:00 am (CET)\n\n\nTitle: Strongly \\(1\\)-Bounded Quantum Group von Neumann Algebras.\nAbstract: Strong \\(1\\)-boundedness is a property for a tracial von Neumann algebra \\(M\\) that was introduced by Jung that allows one to distinguish \\(M\\) from the (interpolated) free group factors. Many examples came from group von Neumann algebras, such as those from certain groups having property (T). For quantum group von Neumann algebras, Brannan and Vergnioux showed in a landmark paper that those coming from the orthogonal free quantum groups are strongly \\(1\\)-bounded, despite sharing many structural properties with the free group factors. We first review these developments, and then report on recent progress concerning permanence of strong \\(1\\)-boundedness under finite index subfactors and applications to quantum automorphism groups such as the quantum permutation group \\(S_{N^2}^+\\). This last part is based on ongoing joint work with Brannan, Harris, and Yamashita.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nHadewijch De Clercq (Ghent University) - November 29, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Dynamical quantum graphical calculus.\nAbstract: Graphical calculus provides a diagrammatic framework for performing topological computations with morphisms in strict tensor categories. The key idea is to identify such morphisms with oriented diagrams labeled by their in- and output objects. This was formalized by Reshetikhin and Turaev, by constructing for every strict tensor category \\(C\\) a strict tensor functor that assigns isotopy classes of \\(C\\)-colored ribbon graphs to morphisms in \\(C\\). This can be applied to the tensor category of finite-dimensional representations of a quantum group \\(U_q(g)\\).\nIn this talk, I will first outline the fundamentals of this finite-dimensional quantum graphical calculus. Then I will explain how it can be extended to a larger category of quantum group representations, encompassing the quantum group analog of the BGG category \\(O\\). In particular, this extended framework allows to visualize \\(U_q(g)\\)-intertwiners on Verma modules, as well as morphisms depending on a dynamical parameter, such as dynamical \\(R\\)-matrices. Finally, I will describe how this dynamical quantum graphical calculus can be used to obtain \\(q\\)-difference equations for quantum spherical functions.\nThis talk is based on joint work with Nicolai Reshetikhin (UC Berkeley) and Jasper Stokman (University of Amsterdam).\n\n\n\n\nSophie Emma Mikkelsen (University of Southern Denmark) - December 13, 2021\n\n\nTitle: On the quantum symplectic sphere.\nAbstract: The algebra of the quantum symplectic \\((4n-1)\\)-sphere \\(O(S_q^{4n-1})\\) is defined as a subalgebra of the quantum symplectic group by Faddeev, Reshetikhin and Takhtajan. Recently D’Andrea and Landi investigated faithfull irreducible \\(*\\)-representations of \\(O(S_q^{4n-1})\\). They proved that the first \\(n-1\\) generators of its enveloping \\(C^*\\)-algebra \\(C(S_q^{4n-1})\\) are all zero. The result is a generalisation of the case where \\(n=2\\) which was shown by Mikkelsen and Szymański.\nIn this talk, I will first present how \\(C(S_q^{4n-1})\\) can be described as a graph \\(C^*\\)-algebra, from which it follows that \\(C(S_q^{4n-1})\\) is isomorphic to the quantum \\((2n+1)\\)-sphere by Vaksman and Soibelman. Then, I present a candidate of a vector space basis for \\(O(S_q^{4n-1})\\) which is constructed by a nontrivial application of the Diamond lemma. The conjecture is supported by computer experiments for \\(n=1,\\ldots,8\\). By finding a vector space basis we can moreover conclude that the \\(n-1\\) generators are non-zero inside the algebra \\(O(S_q^{4n-1})\\).\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nWinter Session\n\n\nJeremiah McCarthy (Munster Technological University) - January 24, 2022\n\n\nTitle: The Frucht property in the quantum group setting.\nAbstract: A classical theorem of Frucht states that every finite group is the automorphism group of a finite graph.

We will focus on certain colored graphs constructed from linear constraint systems. In particular, we will give an explicit connection of the solution group of the linear constraint system and the quantum automorphism group of the corresponding colored graph. Using this connection and a decoloring procedure, we will present an example of a graph with quantum symmetry and finite quantum automorphism group.

In recent years, this result was generalized to more general groups and quantum groups. Here we presented an extension to certain locally compact quantum groups. It covers the known results and the proof is simpler. It also yields a family of \\(L^p\\)-Fourier multipliers over compact quantum groups of Kac type.

The connection between compact quantum groups and the combinatorics of partitions goes back to Banica’s founding work on the representation theory of free orthogonal quantum groups, and was later formalized in the seminal paper of Banica and Speicher under the theory of “easy quantum groups”. Based on some new alternative version of the Tannaka-Krein reconstruction procedure for ergodic actions, we extend Banica and Speicher’s combinatorial approach to the setting of ergodic actions of compact quantum groups. Our examples in particular recovers actions on finite spaces, on embedded homogeneous spaces and on quotient spaces. Moreover, we use this categorical point of view to study the quantum rigidity of ergodic actions on classical spaces, and show that the free quantum groups cannot act ergodically on a classical connected compact space, thereby answering a question of D. Goswami and H. Huang.\nThe talk is based on the recent preprint arXiv:2112.07506 jointly with Amaury Freslon and Frank Taipe.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nPhilipp Schmitt (Leibniz Universität Hannover) - March 7,2022 at 9:00 am (CET)\n\n\nTitle: Quantization of the \\(2\\)-sphere.\nAbstract: The quantization problem is the problem of associating non-commutative quantum algebras to a classical Poisson algebra in such a way that the commutator is related to the Poisson bracket. In a formal setting, this problem and its equivariant counterpart are well-understood and can always be solved (under a mild assumption in the equivariant case). However, in a \\(C^*\\)-algebraic setting, there exist obstructions to equivariant quantization, for example for the \\(2\\)-sphere. In this talk, we will give a brief introduction to the quantization problem, and propose a way to obtain an equivariant quantization of the \\(2\\)-sphere in a Fréchet algebraic setting.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nSpring Session\n\n\nSuvrajit Bhattacharjee (Charles University) - March 28, 2022\n\n\nTitle: Braided quantum symmetries of graph \\(C^*\\)-algebras.\nAbstract: A braided compact quantum group (over \\(T\\)) is, roughly speaking, a “compact quantum group” object in the category of \\(T\\)-\\(C^*\\)-algebras equipped with a twisted monoidal structure. In this talk, we shall explain the existence of a universal braided compact quantum group acting on a graph \\(C^*\\)-algebra in the category mentioned above. Time permitting, we shall sketch the proof, constructing along the way a braided analogue of the free unitary quantum group. Finally, as an example, we shall compute this universal braided compact quantum group for the Cuntz algebra.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nAli Asahi-Vasfi (Institute of Mathematics of the Czech Academy of Sciences) - April 4, 2022\n\n\nTitle: An introduction to crossed products by group actions on \\(C^*\\)-algebras.\nAbstract: We give a survey of some results on crossed products by discrete group actions and discuss their basic properties. Further, we restrict our attention to finite group actions with the Rokhlin property, approximate representability, and their weakened versions. Time permitting, we outline some structure results for the crossed products by these classes of group actions and their contributions to finite-dimensional quantum groups.\n\n\n\n\nPierre Bieliavsky (Université Catholique de Louvain) - April 11, 2022\n\n\nTitle: On the differential geometry of Lie groups of Fröbenius type.\nAbstract: The talk will be based on the papers:\n\nIn the first one, joint with V. Gayral (Memoirs AMS 2015), we construct universal deformation formulae for actions on topological algebras (\\(C^*\\) or Fréchet) of the Lie groups which carries a negatively curved left-invariant Kähler structure.\nA second one, joint with V. Gayral, S. Neshveyev and L. Tuset, where we construct locally compact quantum groups from star products on a class of Lie groups.\n\nThe Lie groups on which these deformations are performed (in both (1) and (2)) are of “Frobenius type’’. This means that their Lie algebras carry an exact non-degenerate two-cocycle or, equivalently, that they admit an open co-adjoint orbit. In both cases, the star products, say at the formal level, are of Fedosov type i.e. associated with a left-invariant symplectic torsion free affine connection on the group manifold at hand. In particular, they are obtained from differential theoretical considerations.\nHowever, there is a dichotomy: the orderings of the star products considered in (1) and (2) are different. In (1), we deal with Weyl ordered star products, while in (2) with normal (or anti-normal) ones. This has, apparently, a strong effect on the regularity of the categories those constructions live in: smooth versus measurable or topological.\nMore precisely: In (1), we definitely deal with a “smooth object”, e.g. the universal deformation formula (i.e. the twist) allows to deform smooth vectors of the group action, e.g. they are relevant in differential noncommutative geometry in the sense of A. Connes. But, no locally compact quantum group is present there. And until now, I haven’t be able to define a reasonable notion of “smooth quantum group” attached to the construction. In (2), the quantum group is present, but the deformation procedure apparently breaks smoothness: smooth vectors of strongly continuous actions (i.e. smooth module-algebras) of the group are not stable under twisting.\nIn the talk, I will discuss differential geometrical aspects of Frobenius Lie groups within this deformation quantization context. I will end with a suggestion based on the possible use of a Lie group theoretical version of a microlocal analytical tool: Hörmander’s smooth wave front set.\n\n\n\n\nLucas Hataishi (University of Oslo) - May 16, 2022\n\n\nTitle: Yetter-Drinfeld algebras, module categories and injectivity.\nAbstract: Many examples of quantum group actions carry a Yetter-Drinfeld structure. Among them, you find C*-algebras coming from the boundary theory of Drinfeld doubles, which is closely related to the theory of ucp maps and injective envelopes of Hamana. Exploring Tannaka-Krein duality for quantum group actions, it is possible to extend many concepts and results of boundary theory to the categorical setting, but the lack of a categorification of non-braided-commutative Yetter-Drinfeld algebras impose an obstruction to a full analogy. In this talk, I will sketch how to perform such a categorification and relate it to the study of injectivity for module categories. Based on joint works with E. Habbestad, S. Neshveyev and M. Yamashita.\n\n\n\n\nSebastian Halbig (Technische Universität Dresden) - May 30, 2022\n\n\nTitle: Pivotality, twisted centres and the anti-double of a Hopf monad.\nAbstract: Pairs in involution are an algebraic structure whose systematic study is motivated by their applications in knot theory, representation theory and cyclic homology theories. In this talk, we will explore a categorical view for these objects from the perspective of representation theory of monoidal categories. A focus will lie on illustrating how their existence is linked to a particular well-behaved notion of duality called pivotality. In particular, we will show how the language of monads allows us to combine the algebraic with the categorical perspective of these pairs.\nThis talk is based on the article arXiv:2201.05361.\n\n\n\n\nJohan Konings (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) - June 6, 2022\n\n\nTitle: Partial algebraic quantum groups and their Drinfeld doubles.\nAbstract: In this talk, we will define partial algebraic quantum groups, which are special cases of weak multiplier Hopf algebras, as introduced by Van Daele and Wang. At the same time, they provide a generalization to the notion of a partial compact quantum group, as introduced by De Commer and Timmermann. The main aim of the talk will be to realize the Drinfeld double of a partial compact quantum group as a partial algebraic quantum group.\nThis talk is based on joint work with K.

We describe a class of examples arising from HNN extensions.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nRoberto Hernández Palomares (Texas A&M University) - June 27, 2022\n\n\nTitle: \\(Q\\)-systems and higher unitary idempotent completion for \\(C^*\\)-algebras.\nAbstract: \\(Q\\)-systems were introduced by Longo to study finite index inclusions of infinite von Neumann factors. A \\(Q\\)-system is a unitary version of a Frobenius algebra object in a tensor category or a \\(C^*\\) \\(2\\)-category. By the work of Müger, \\(Q\\)-systems give an axiomatization of the standard invariant of a finite index subfactor.\nFollowing work of Douglass-Reutter, a \\(Q\\)-system is also a unitary version of a higher idempotent. In this talk, we will describe a higher unitary idempotent completion for \\(C^*\\) 2-categories called \\(Q\\)-system completion.\nOur main goal is to show that \\(C^*\\text{Alg}\\), the \\(C^*\\) \\(2\\)-category of right correspondences of unital \\(C^*\\)-algebras is \\(Q\\)-system complete. To do so, we will use the graphical calculus for \\(C^*\\) \\(2\\)-categories, and adapt a subfactor reconstruction technique called realization, which is inverse to \\(Q\\)-system completion. This result allows for the straightforward adaptation of subfactor results to \\(C^*\\)-algebras, characterizing finite index extensions of unital \\(C^*\\)-algebras equipped with a faithful conditional expectation in terms of the \\(Q\\)-systems in \\(C^*\\text{Alg}\\). If time allows, we will discuss an application to induce new symmetries of \\(C^*\\)-algebras from old via \\(Q\\)-system completion.\nThis is joint work with Chen, C. Jones and Penneys (arXiv: 2105.12010).\n\n\n\n\nHarshit Yadav (Rice University) - July 4, 2022\n\n\nTitle: Filtered Frobenius algebras in monoidal categories.\nAbstract: We develop filtered-graded techniques for algebras in monoidal categories with the goal of establishing a categorical version of Bongale’s 1967 result: A filtered deformation of a Frobenius algebra over a field is Frobenius as well. Towards the goal, we construct a monoidal associated graded functor, building on prior works of Ardizzoni-Menini, of Galatius et al., and of Gwillian-Pavlov. We then produce equivalent conditions for an algebra in a rigid monoidal category to be Frobenius in terms of the existence of categorical Frobenius form. These two results of independent interest are used to achieve our goal. As an application of our main result, we show that any exact module category over a symmetric finite tensor category is represented by a Frobenius algebra in it. This is joint work with Dr. Chelsea Walton (Rice University).\nSlides"

In this talk, we will discuss a quantized version of this law: we consider the reflection equation -algebra (REA), which is a quantization of the -algebra of polynomial functions on self-adjoint matrices, together with a natural adjoint action by quantum \\(GL(N,C)\\). We then show that to each irreducible bounded *-representation of the REA can be associated an extended signature \\((N_+,N_-,N_0,[r])\\) with \\([r]\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}\\), and we will explain in what way this is a complete invariant of the orbits under the action by quantum \\(GL(N,C)\\).

This structure conveniently handles the usual homological algebra, bootstrap constructions and assembly maps involved in many KK-theoretical calculations, e.g. in connection with the Baum-Connes conjecture. As with any tensor triangulated category, we can also associate to the G-equivariant Kasparov category its spectrum in the sense of Paul Balmer. This is a topological space (similar to the Zariski spectrum of a commutative ring) which allows us, as it were, to re-inject some genuinely geometric ideas in non-commutative geometry. It turns out that the spectrum contains enough information to prove the Baum-Connes conjecture for \\(G\\), hence we should expect the question of its computation to be very hard. In this talk, after discussing such preliminaries and motivation, I will present joint work with Ralf Meyer providing the state of the art on this subject. Although more general partial results are known, a complete answer is only known so far for finite groups of prime order and for algebras in the bootstrap category.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nMartijn Caspers (TU Delft) - December 7, 2020\n\n\nTitle: Riesz transforms on compact quantum groups and strong solidity.\nAbstract: The Riesz transform is one of the most important and classical examples of a Fourier multiplier on the real numbers. It may be described as the operator \\(\\nabla_j \\Delta^{-1/2}\\) where \\(\\nabla_j = d/dx_j\\) is the derivative and Delta is the Laplace operator. In a more general context the Riesz transform may always be defined for any diffusion semigroup on the reals. In case the generator of this semi-group is the Laplace operator the classical Riesz transform is retrieved. In quantum probability the quantum Markov semi-groups play the role of the diffusion semi-groups and again a suitable notion of Riesz transform can be described.\nIn this paper we show that the Riesz transform may be used to prove rigidity properties of von Neumann algebras. We focus in particular on examples from compact quantum groups. Using these tools we show that a class of quantum groups admits rigidity properties. The class has the following properties:\n\n\\(SU_q(2)\\) is contained in it.\nThe class is stable under monoidal equivalence, free products, dual quantum subgroups and wreath products with \\(S_N^+\\).\n\nThe rigidity properties include the Akemann-Ostrand property and strong solidity.

The aim of my talk is to introduce the basics of this theory, and explain some new results on dynamical systems of compact quantum metric spaces. If time permits, I will also touch upon another recent result, which shows how quantized intervals approximate a classical interval in the quantum version of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance.

Subfactor classification has led to discovery of interesting “exotic” quantum symmetries and to important constructions for unitary tensor categories. For example, \\(Q\\)-systems (special \\(^C*\\) Frobnius algebra objects) were introduced by Longo to characterize the canonical endomorphism for type III subfactors, which is the analog of Jones’ basic construction for type II_1 and Kosaki’s version for type III. We will use this perspective to discuss some subfactor results which go beyond small index classification, making connections to quantum groups along the way.

Even for one of the simplest examples, the random transposition walk, precise results concerning the convergence to equilibrium were only very recently obtained. After briefly describing that setting, I will report on a joint work with L. Teyssier and S. Wang where we study an analogue of the random transposition walk on the quantum symmetric group, therefore a kind of “quantum card shuffle”. In particular, we obtain a similar asymptotic description of the convergence to equilibrium, called the “limit profile”, involving the free Poisson distribution while the classical case involved the usual Poisson distribution.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nDaniel K.

The first two types of support data are then used in a theorem that gives a method for the explicit classification of the thick (two-sided) ideals and the Balmer spectrum of an M\\(\\Delta\\)C. The third type (quasi support) is used in another theorem that provides a method for the explicit classification of the thick right ideals of \\(\\mathbf K\\), which in turn can be applied to classify the thick two-sided ideals and \\(\\text{Spc} {\\mathbf K}\\).\nIf time permits applications will be given for quantum groups and non-cocommutative finite-dimensional Hopf algebras studied by Benson and Witherspoon.\nThis is joint and ongoing work with Milen Yakimov and Kent Vashaw.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nArnaud Brothier (University of New South Wales) - March 8,2021 at 9:00 am (CET)\n\n\nTitle: From subfactors to actions of the Thompson group.\nAbstract: In his quest in constructing conformal field theories from subfactors Vaughan Jones found an efficient machine to construct actions of groups like the Thompson groups.

Some of the results presented come from joint works with Vaughan Jones and with Valeriano Aiello and Roberto Conti.\n\n\n\n\nRéamonn Ó Buachalla (Charles University) - March 15, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Quantum Root Vectors and a Dolbeault Double Complex for the A-Series Quantum Flag Manifolds.\nAbstract: In the 2000s a series of seminal papers by Heckenberger and Kolb introduced an essentially unique covariant \\(q\\)-deformed de Rham complex for the irreducible quantum flag manifolds. In the years since, it has become increasingly clear that these differential graded algebras have a central role to play in the noncommutative geometry of Drinfeld–Jimbo quantum groups. Until now, however, the question of how to extend Heckenberger and Kolb’s construction beyond the irreducible case has not been examined. Here we address this question for the \\(A\\)-series Drinfeld–Jimbo quantum groups \\(U_q(\\frak{sl}_{n+1})\\), and show that for precisely two reduced decompositions of the longest element of the Weyl group, Lusztig’s associated space of quantum root vectors gives a quantum tangent space for the full quantum flag manifold \\(\\mathcal{O}_q(F_{n+1})\\) with associated differential graded algebra of classical dimension. Moreover, its restriction to the quantum Grassmannians recovers the \\(q\\)-deformed complex of Heckenberger and Kolb, giving a conceptual explanation for their origin. Time permitting, we will discuss the noncommutative K\"ahler geometry of thesespaces and the proposed extension of the root space construction to the other series. (Joint work with P. Somberg)."

The quest for constant solutions of YBE (\\(R\\)-matrices) is at the very origin of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups and their universal R-matrix. Similarly, constant solutions of RE (\\(k\\)-matrices) naturally appear in the context of quantum symmetric pairs (QSP).\nIn joint work with Bart Vlaar, we construct a discrete family of universal \\(k\\)-matrices associated to an arbitrary quantum symmetric Kac-Moody pair as operators on category O integrable representations. This generalises previous results by Balagovic-Kolb and Bao-Wang valid for finite-type QSP. In this talk, I will explain how, in affine type, this construction gives rise to parameter-dependent operators (spectral \\(k\\)-matrices) on finite-dimensional representations of quantum loop algebras solving the same RE introduced by Cherednik and Sklyanin in the 1980s in the context of quantum integrability near a boundary.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nDebashish Goswami (Indian Statistical Institute) - March 29, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Quantum Galois Group of Subfactors.\nAbstract: In this talk, I prove the existence of a universal (terminal) object in a number of categories of Hopf algebras acting on a given subfactor \\(N \\subset M\\) (finite index, type II_1) such that N is in the fixed point subalgebra of the action. These universal Hopf algebras can be interpreted as a quantum group version of Galois group of the subfactor. We compute such universal quantum groups for certain class of subfactors, notably those coming outer actions of finite dimensional Hopf \\(*\\) algebras (joint work with Suvrajit Bhattacharjee and Alex Chirvsitu).\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nDavid Reutter (Max Planck Institute of Mathematics) - April 12, 2021\n\n\nTitle: On fusion \\(2\\)-categories.\nAbstract: I will revisit and categorify concepts from the theory of fusion categories — including idempotent completeness and semi-simplicity, ultimately leading to a notion of `fusion \\(2\\)-category’. I will highlight structural similarities and differences between fusion \\(1\\)- and \\(2\\)-categories and discuss several concrete examples. If time permits, I will discuss the role of fusion \\(2\\)-categories as a natural building block for \\(4\\)-dimensional topological field theories.\n\n\n\n\nAleandru Chirvasitu (University at Buffalo) - April 19, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Non-commutative balls and quantum group structures\nAbstract: The Toeplitz algebra attached to the unit disk is the universal \\(C^*\\)-algebra generated by an isometry, and is a non-commutative analogue of the unit disk. Similarly, one can attach algebras to non-commutative counterparts of non-compact Hermitian symmetric spaces. I will discuss results to the effect that such quantum spaces cannot admit quantum group structures, i.e. their attached non-commutative “function algebras” do not admit reasonable Hopf algebra structures.\n(joint w/ Jacek Krajczok and Piotr Soltan)\n\n\n\n\nAlexander Shapiro (UC Berkeley) - April 26, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Cluster realization of spherical DAHA.\nAbstract: Spherical subalgebra of Cherednik’s double affine Hecke algebra of type A admits a polynomial representation in which its generators act via elementary symmetric functions and Macdonald operators. Recognizing the elementary symmetric functions as eigenfunctions of quantum Toda Hamiltonians, and applying (the inverse of) the Toda spectral transform, one obtains a new representation of spherical DAHA. In this talk, I will discuss how this new representation gives rise to an injective homomorphism from the spherical DAHA into a quantum cluster algebra in such a way that the action of the modular group on the former is realized via cluster transformations. The talk is based on a joint work in progress with Philippe Di Francesco, Rinat Kedem, and Gus Schrader.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nCorey Jones (North Carolina State University) - May 3, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Actions of fusion categories on topological spaces.\nAbstract: Fusion categories are algebraic objects which generalize the representation categories of finite quantum groups. We define an action of a (unitary) fusion category \\(C\\) on a compact Hausdorff space \\(X\\) to be a \\(C\\)-module category structure on \\(\\text{Hilb}(X)\\), the category of finite dimensional Hilbert bundles over a compact Hausdorff space \\(X\\). When \\(X\\) is connected, we discuss obstructions to the existence of such actions and describe techniques for building examples.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nRémi Boutonnet (Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux) - May 10, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Non-commutative ergodic theory of semi-simple lattices.\nAbstract: In the late 90’s, Nevo and Zimmer wrote a series of papers describing the general structure of stationnary actions of higher rank semi-simple Lie groups \\(G\\) on probability spaces. With Cyril Houdayer we extended this result in two ways: first we upgraded it to actions on non-commutative spaces (von Neumann algebras), and we also managed to study actions of lattices in \\(G\\). I will explain this non-commutative ergodic theorem and the main ingredients of proof, and give striking consequences on the unitary representations of these lattices and their characters.\n\n\n\n\nLaura Mančiska (University of Copenhagen) - May 24, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Quantum groups and nonlocal games.\nAbstract: In this talk I will explain how quantum groups arise in quantum information theory via a class of graph based nonlocal games. Our point of departure will be an interactive protocol (nonlocal game) where two provers try to convince a verifier that two graphs are isomorphic. Allowing provers to take advantage of shared quantum mechanical resources will then allow us to define quantum isomorphism of graphs as the ability of quantum players to win the corresponding game with certainty. We will see that quantum isomorphism can be naturally reformulated in the language of quantum groups.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nPaolo Saracco (Université Libre de Bruxelles) - May 31, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Globalization for Geometric Partial Comodules.\nAbstract: The study of partial symmetries (partial actions and coactions, partial representations and corepresentations, partial comodule algebras) is a relatively recent field in continuous expansion and, therein, one of the relevant questions is the existence and uniqueness of a so-called globalization (or enveloping action). For instance, in the framework of partial actions of groups any global action of a group \\(G\\) on a set induces a partial action of the group on any subset by restriction. The idea behind the concept of globalization of a given partial action is to find a (universal) \\(G\\)-set such that the initial partial action can be realized as the restriction of this global one.\nWe propose here a categorical approach to partial symmetries and the globalization question, explaining several of the existing results and, at the same time, providing a procedure to construct globalizations in concrete contexts of interest. Our approach relies on the notion of geometric partial comodules, recently introduced by Hu and Vercruysse in order to describe partial actions of algebraic groups from a Hopf-algebraic point of view.\nUnlike classical partial actions, which exist only for (topological) groups and Hopf algebras, geometric partial comodules can be defined over any coalgebra in a monoidal category with pullbacks and they allow to describe phenomena that are out of the reach of the theory of partial (co)actions, even in the Hopf algebra framework. At the same time, geometric partial comodules allow to approach in a unified way partial actions of groups on sets, partial coactions of Hopf algebras on algebras and partial (co)actions of Hopf algebras on vector spaces. Thus, the question of studying the existence (and uniqueness) of globalization for geometric partial comodules naturally arises as a unifying way to address the issue.\nBased on a joint work with Joost Vercruysse.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nAryan Ghobadi (Queen Mary University of London) - June 7, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Hopf algebras in SupLat and set-theoretical YBE solutions.\nAbstract: Skew braces have recently attracted attention as a method to study set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. In this talk, we will present a new approach for studying these solutions, by looking at Hopf algebras in the category of complete lattices and join-preserving morphisms, denoted by SupLat. Any Hopf algebra, \\(H\\) in SupLat, has a corresponding group, \\(R(H)\\), which we call its remnant and a co-quasitriangular structure on \\(H\\) induces a brading operator on \\(R(H)\\), which induces a skew brace structure on \\(R(H)\\). From this correspondence, we will recover several aspects of the theory of skew braces. In particular, we will construct the universal skew brace of a set-theoretical YBE solution, as the remnant of an FRT-type reconstruction in SupLat.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nSatyajit Guin (IIT Kanpur) - June 14, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Equivariant spectral triple for the compact quantum group \\(U_q(2)\\) for complex deformation parameters.\nAbstract: Let \\(q=|q|e^{i\\pi\\theta}\\) be a nonzero complex number such that \\(|q|\\neq 1\\), and consider the compact quantum group \\(U_q(2)\\). In this talk, we discuss a complete list of inequivalent irreducible representations of ¢ and its Peter-Weyl decomposition. Then, for \\(\\theta\\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\backslash\\{0,1\\}\\), we discuss the K-theory of the underlying \\(C^*\\)-algebra \\(C(U_q(2))\\), and a spectral triple which is equivariant under its own comultiplication action. The spectral triple obtained here is even, \\(4^+\\)-summable, non-degenerate, and the Dirac operator acts on two copies of the \\(L^2\\)-space of \\(U_q(2)\\). The Chern character of the associated Fredholm module is nontrivial.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nMoritz Weber (Saarland University) - June 21, 2021\n\n\nTitle: Orthogonal vs unitary in the case of “easy” quantum groups.\nAbstract: We consider quantum subgroups of Wang’s free orthogonal quantum group on the one hand and of his free unitary quantum group on the other. In the first case, the generators of the underlying \\(C^*\\)-algebras are selfadjoint which is dropped in the latter case. We compare these two cases along the lines of so called “easy” quantum groups and we observe that the step from the orthogonal to the unitary case is huge. This is a survey talk on the landscape of “easy” quantum groups with a particular emphasis on the differences between the orthogonal and the unitary case.\nSlides"

For example, the reduced \\(C^*\\)-algebra \\(C^*_r(G)\\) of a discrete group has a unique tracial state if and only if there are no non-trivial amenable normal subgroups. This, among other related results, makes it apparent that the structure of the amenable subgroups of G contains important information about \\(C^*_r(G)\\). For a quantum group \\(\\mathbb{G}\\), an appropriate analogue of a subgroup is a coideal \\(N ⊆ L^\\infty(\\mathbb{G})\\). We will present notions of relative amenability, amenability, and coamenability for coideals of discrete and compact quantum groups motivated by “relativizations” of amenability and coamenability of a subgroup of a group. We will discuss the known relationships between these formally distinct notions and their relevance to certain properties of the reduced \\(C^*\\)-algebras of discrete quantum groups.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nMagnus Landstad (Norwegian University of Science and Technology) - November 8, 2022\n\n\nTitle: Exotic group algebras, crossed products, and coactions.\nAbstract: If \\(G\\) is a locally compact group, we have the full group \\(C^*\\)-algebra \\(C^*(G)\\) and the reduced \\(C^*_r(G)\\). We call a \\(C^*\\)-algebra properly between \\(C^*(G)\\) and \\(C^*_r(G)\\) exotic.\nSimilarly, if G acts on a \\(C^*\\)-algebra \\(A\\) we can form the full crossed product \\(C^*(G\\ltimes A)\\) and the reduced crossed product \\(C^*_r(G\\ltimes A)\\). An exotic crossed product is a \\(C^*\\)-algebra properly between the two. Work by Baum, Guentner, and Willett show that these algebras are relevant to the Baum-Connes conjecture.\nWe think that the best way to study these algebras is by also looking at the corresponding dual theory of coactions. I will discuss some of these aspects, but there will be more questions than answers.\nThis is joint work with Steve Kaliszewski and John Quigg.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nAlfons Van Daele (KU Leuven) - November 15, 2022\n\n\nTitle: Algebraic quantum hypergroups and duality.\nAbstract: Let \\(G\\) be a finite group and \\(H\\) a subgroup. The set \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) of double cosets \\(HpH\\), with \\(p\\in G\\) has the structure of an hypergroup. The product of two elements \\(HpH\\) and \\(HqH\\) is the set of cosets \\(HrH\\) where \\(r\\in pHq\\). The algebra \\(A\\) of functions on \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) is the space of functions on \\(G\\) that are constant on double cosets. It carries a natural coproduct, dual to the product, and given by \\(\\Delta(p,q)=1/n \\sum_{h\\in H} f(phq)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in \\(H\\). The dual algebra is known as the Hecke algebra associated with the pair \\((G, H)\\).\nIn this talk I will discuss the notion of an algebraic quantum hypergroup, its fundamental properties and duality for algebraic quantum hypergroups. I will illustrate this with an example, coming from bicrossproduct theory, constructed from a pair of closed subgroups \\(H\\) and \\(K\\) of a group \\(G\\), with the assumption that the map \\(H\\cap K = {e}\\).\nThis is part of more general work in progress with M.

We construct the quantum automorphism group of any connected locally finite, possibly infinite, graph as a locally compact quantum group that has the classical (locally compact) automorphism group as a closed quantum subgroup. For finite graphs, we get the quantum automorphism group of Banica and Bichon. One of the key tools is the construction of a unitary tensor category associated with any connected locally finite graph. When this graph is the Cayley graph of a finitely generated group, the associated unitary tensor category has a canonical fiber functor. We thus also obtain a quantization procedure for arbitrary finitely generated groups. In the particular example of groups defined by a triangle presentation, this construction gives the property (T) discrete quantum groups from earlier joint work with Valvekens.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nFatemeh Khosravi (Seoul National University) - November 29, 2022 at 11:00 am (CET)\n\n\nTitle: Co-amenable quantum homogeneous spaces of compact Kac quantum groups.\nAbstract: Given a locally compact group \\(G\\), Leptin’s theorem states that \\(G\\) is amenable if and only if the Fourier algebra \\(A(G)\\) admits a bounded approximate identity, where the latter property is known as co-amenability of the quantum dual of \\(G\\). In the quantum setting, this characterization is known as the duality between amenability and co-amenability. It is proved that a discrete quantum group is amenable if and only if its dual compact quantum group is co-amenable. The definition of co-amenability for quantum homogeneous spaces is given by Kalantar-Kasprzak-Skalski-Vergnioux. Furthermore, they ask whether the co-amenability of a quantum homogeneous space is equivalent to the (relative) amenability of its co-dual. In this talk, we will answer this question for quantum homogeneous spaces of compact Kac quantum groups under a mild assumption. Based on joint work with Mehrdad Kalantar.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nErik Habbestad (University of Oslo) - December 13, 2022\n\n\nTitle: \\(C^*\\)-algebras associated to Temperley-Lieb polynomials.\nAbstract: We define Temperley-Lieb polynomials and consider the (standard) subproduct systems they generate. This subproduct system turns out to be equivariant with respect to a compact quantum group \\(G\\) monoidally equivalent to \\(U_q(2)\\). Exploiting this we are able to describe the \\(C^*\\)-algebras associated to the subproduct system, which turn out to be closesly related to the linking algebra \\(B(U_q(2),G)\\). This is joint work with Sergey Neshveyev.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nKan Kitamura (University of Tokyo) - December 20, 2022\n\n\nTitle: Partial Pontryagin duality for actions of quantum groups on \\(C^*\\)-algebras.\nAbstract: We compare actions on \\(C^*\\)-algebras of two constructions of locally compact quantum groups, the bicrossed product due to Vaes-Vainerman and the double crossed product due to Baaj-Vaes. We give a one-to-one correspondence between them up to Morita equivalence, in the same spirit as Takesaki-Takai and Baaj-Skandalis dualities. This includes a duality between a quantum double and the product of the original quantum group with its opposite. We will explain its consequences for equivariant Kasparov theory in relation to the quantum analog of the Baum-Connes conjecture.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nWinter Session\n\n\nJulia Plavnik (Indiana University Bloomington) - January 24, 2023\n\n\nTitle: Comparing different constructions of modular categories.\nAbstract: Modular categories arise naturally in many areas of mathematics, such as conformal field theory, representations of braid groups, quantum groups, and Hopf algebras, and low dimensional topology, and they have important applications in condensed matter physics.\nDespite recent progress in the classification of modular categories, we are still in the early stages of this theory and the general landscape remains largely unexplored. One important step towards deepening our understanding of modular categories is to have well-studied constructions. In this talk, we will present an overview of various of these constructions and compare their properties. We will focus on ribbon zesting and symmetry gauging, and we will comment on some constructions in the \\(G\\)-crossed setting.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nMatthew Daws (University of Central Lancashire) - January 31, 2023\n\n\nTitle: Around the Approximation Property for Quantum Groups.\nAbstract: I will introduce what the “approximation property” (AP) is for (locally compact) groups, and provide a few applications. I will then talk about how one might give an analogous definition for (locally compact) quantum groups, explaining some of the need technology along the way. Time allowing, I will discuss how the AP interacts with various common constructions, and also about “central” versions and links with tensor categories.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nOleg Aristov - February 7, 2023\n\n\nTitle: Complex-analytic approach to quantum groups.\nAbstract: We discuss quantum analogues of complex Lie groups. Our approach is closer to classical quantum group theory than to \\(C^*\\)-algebraic one (no multipliers and no invariant weights). I propose to consider a topological Hopf algebra with a finiteness condition (holomorphically ﬁnitely generated or HFG for short). This topic seems to offer a wide range of research opportunities.\nOur focus is on examples, such as analytic forms of some classical quantum groups (a deformation of a solvable Lie group and Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras). I also present some general results: (1) the category of Stein groups is anti-equivalent to the category of commutative Hopf HFG algebras; (2) If \\(G\\) is a compactly generated Lie group, the associated convolution cocommutative topological Hopf algebra (introduced by Akbarov) is HFG. When, in addition, \\(G\\) is connected and linear, the structure of this cocommutative algebra can be described explicitly. I also plan to discuss briefly holomorphic duality (which is parallel to Pontryagin duality).\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nArthur Troupel (Université de Paris) - February 14, 2023\n\n\nTitle: Free wreath products as fundamental graph \\(C^*\\)-algebras.\nAbstract: The free wreath product of a compact quantum group by the quantum permutation group \\(S_N^+\\) has been introduced by Bichon in order to give a quantum counterpart of the classical wreath product. The representation theory of such groups is well-known, but some results about their operator algebras were still open, for example Haagerup property, K-amenability or factoriality of the von Neumann algebra. I will present a joint work with Pierre Fima in which we identify these algebras with the fundamental \\(C^*\\)-algebras of certain graphs of \\(C^*\\)-algebras, and we deduce these properties from these constructions.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nDevarshi Mukherjee (Universidad de Buenos Aires) - February 21, 2023\n\n\nTitle: Noncommutative geometry in mixed characteristic.\nAbstract: I will give an overview of noncommutative topological algebras and their cohomology theories in the setting of the p-adic integers.\nThis will entail constructions that are familiar from the complex case, such as the formation of a smooth subalgebra of a \\(C^*\\)-algebra. The examples I will specialise these constructions to are group algebras of discrete and p-adic Lie groups. It turns out that these are also examples of bornological quantum groups (in the sense of Voigt). Finally, if time permits, I will also discuss the computations of the Hochschild homology of the completions of such algebras.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nMao Hoshino (University of Tokyo) - March 7, 2023\n\n\nTitle: Equivariant covering spaces of quantum homogeneous spaces.\nAbstract: In this talk I will explain the imprimitivity theorems for equivariant correspondences in two cases: for a general compact quantum group under a finiteness condition, and for the Drinfeld-Jimbo deformation of a semisimple compact Lie group. These results involve the representation theories of function algebras and the Tannaka-Krein duality for equivariant correspondences. I also would like to give some applications if time allows.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nMelody Molander (UC Santa Barbara) - March 14, 2023\n\n\nTitle: Skein Theory for Affine ADE Subfactor Planar Algebras.\nAbstract: Subfactor planar algebras first were constructed by Vaughan Jones as a diagrammatic axiomatization of the standard invariant of a subfactor. These planar algebras also encode two other invariants of the subfactors: the index and the principal graph. The Kuperberg Program asks to find all diagrammatic presentations of subfactor planar algebras. This program has been completed for index less than \\(4\\). In this talk, I will introduce subfactor planar algebras and give some presentations of subfactor planar algebras of index \\(4\\) which have affine ADE Dynkin diagrams as their principal graphs.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nSpring Session\n\n\nYasuyuki Kawahigashi (University of Tokyo) - March 28, 2023 at 1:00 pm (CEST)\n\n\nTitle: Topological order, tensor networks and subfactors.\nAbstract: I will explain interactions between two-dimensional topological order and subfactors from a viewpoint of tensor networks. The range of a certain finite dimensional projection appearing in statistical physics is identified with the higher relative commutant of the subfactor arising from such a tensor network. We then work out the machinery of alpha-induction for braided fusion categories in the setting of certain \\(4\\)-tensors, called bi-unitary connections, appearing in subfactor theory.\n\n\n\n\nMichael Brannan (University of Waterloo) - April 25, 2023\n\n\nTitle: No-signalling bicorrelations and generalized quantum automorphisms of graphs.\nAbstract: I’ll report on some recent joint work with Sam Harris, Lyudmila Turowska and Ivan Todorov (arXiv:2302.04268), where we introduce an analogue of bisynchronous correlations in the context of quantum input-quantum output non-local games. One of the main motivations of this work was to find a non-local game interpretation of the quantum automorphisms and isomorphisms of quantum graphs that have appeared recently in the literature. I’ll explain how these considerations are related to tracial representations of quantum automorphism groups of matrix algebras, and in the case of ordinary graphs, lead us to a softer (and possibly more general) notion of quantum symmetry for graphs.\n\n\n\n\nJoeri De Ro (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) - June 6, 2023\n\n\nTitle: Actions of compact and discrete quantum groups on operator systems.\nAbstract: We introduce the notion of an action of a discrete or compact quantum group on an operator system, and study equivariant operator system injectivity. Given an action of a discrete quantum group on an operator system \\(X\\), we introduce associated crossed products, and we prove that equivariant injectivity of the operator system \\(X\\) is equivalent with dual equivariant injectivity of the associated crossed products. As an application of this result, we prove a duality result for equivariant injective envelopes. This is joint work with Lucas Hataishi.\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nMainak Ghosh (Indian Statistical Institute) - June 20, 2023 at 11:00 am (CEST)\n\n\nTitle: Unitary connections and \\(Q\\)-systems.\nAbstract: The standard invariant plays a major role in subfactor theory. In this talk, I will discuss a \\(2\\)-categorical generalization of an axiomatization of the standard invariant and further discuss some algebraic structures associated to it. This is based on joint work with P. Das, S. Ghosh and C. Jones (arXiv:2211.03822) and on arxiv : 2302.04921."
